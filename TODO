5) enter after a query w/ no results creates a file by that name, or a directory if it ends w/ '/'. 
5a) if you create a directory, navigate into it after creation.
5b) if the file ends in '*', set it to a+x after creation.
6) allow deleting, setting permissions (mostly exec), renaming, and maybe quicklook w/ hotkeys.
7) maybe set it up to read a .gitignore file and not list anything that matches .gitignore...
	 -- A problem is that since it orders by mtime, your .o files are likely listed fairly high and have the
 	same name (minus ext) as your source files, so you have to type out your search + .c in order
 	to eliminate them. How often do you need fast nav to your .o files?
8) allow arrow nav along query, so you can do '/' <- 'somequery' so you can e.g eliminate non-directories
	then search. right now queries are append only.
9) better display/selection graphics. I'd like it to look more like the 10.10 Spotlight search.
