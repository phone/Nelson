1) fuzzy file finder like ido mode finder in emacs
2) finds all files in current directory where letters of QUERY appear in order in filename
3) TAB selects next entry in list, gets re-set to beginning if QUERY changes
4) SHIFT-TAB selects previous entry. Maybe arrow keys should work too.
5) deleting past the last prefix char goes up a directory and re-lists from there.
6) allow deleting, setting permissions (mostly exec), renaming, and maybe quicklook w/ hotkeys.
